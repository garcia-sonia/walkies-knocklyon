                    no longer have the stamina to take you dog on long walks, especially during the winter
                    months.</li>

                <li>We understand how important it is to keep your four legged friend at home with you and how
                    much love and companionship dogs can provide.</li>

                <li>Here at Walkies, we also aim to provide tailored services so please don't hesitate to get in
                    touch if you have other needs like short-term fostering for your dog during hospital stays.

        <ul>
            <li>Dogs can help reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and increase social interaction and physical activity.</li>
            <li>Dogs' love relieves feelings of loneliness.</li>
            <li>Dogs help us stay present and give loving companionship.</li>
            <li>Studies show that dog owners exhibit higher degrees of self-discipline than those without.</li>
            <li>Dogs help you stay safe and independent. They provide ears for the deaf, eyes for the blind and an early warning system at the approach of dangers.</li>
