# WALKIES - Knocklyon

## Site Overview

WALKIES – Knocklyon is a registered charity run by volunteers to support the Senior neighbours of Knocklyon with their dog walking and pet care needs. Their office is based at the Leaf community centre and the catchment area for their services is a 5km radius around the heart of Knocklyon.

WALKIES – Knocklyon was founded on the belief that dog ownership provides great support and loving companionship to seniors, relieving feelings of loneliness and that dogs also provide many other health benefits to seniors like reducing stress, lowering blood pressure and increase social and physical interaction.

As well as dog walking services all year round or just during the winter months, WALKIES – Knocklyon also provides other services like trips to the vet, short-term fostering when needed, sourcing pet supplies, dog socialising, dog training and dog adoption. The charity also strives to provide tailored services for those seniors with other specific pet care needs. Their motto is HAPPY DOGS, HAPPY OWNERS.

## Site Structure 

This website is structured in three different pages: Home, Our Services and Register. Users will be able to find all the information they need to know about the charity, their services, their contact details and how to register as a senior or as a volunteer using the appropriate form. The website also contains information about the many benefits of dog ownership for seniors with a new top pick video every month. There are also relevant announcements on all pages regarding the charity’s new launched newsletter, coffee morning meet ups, and offering help to senior neighbours of other areas to connect with their local support groups. Finally, the Register page also includes information about how to donate and promotes the need for volunteers and the dog adoption services.

## Site consistency

The consistency of the website is achieved through the regular use of the same header and footer accross all pages.
Other recurrent features are the use of round edged images accross all pages, the regular use of solid font awesome icons and a clearly defined background color palette including white, orange and a soft shade of green. 
Fonts are also consistent accross the site with the use of Lato, sans serif in the body and Oswald, sans serif in headers. Font colors are mainly black, but also white and orange depending on the background color or to highligt links accross the site.
