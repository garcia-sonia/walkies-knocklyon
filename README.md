# WALKIES - Knocklyon

## Site Overview

WALKIES – Knocklyon is a registered charity run by volunteers to support the Senior neighbours of Knocklyon with their dog walking and pet care needs. Their office is based at the Leaf community centre and the catchment area for their services is a 5km radius around the heart of Knocklyon.

WALKIES – Knocklyon was founded on the belief that dog ownership provides great support and loving companionship to seniors, relieving feelings of loneliness and that dogs also provide many other health benefits to seniors like reducing stress, lowering blood pressure and increase social and physical interaction.

As well as dog walking services all year round or just during the winter months, WALKIES – Knocklyon also provides other services like trips to the vet, short-term fostering when needed, sourcing pet supplies, dog socialising, dog training and dog adoption. The charity also strives to provide tailored services for those seniors with other specific pet care needs. Their motto is HAPPY DOGS, HAPPY OWNERS.

## Site Structure 

- This website is structured in three different pages: Home, Our Services and Register. 
- Users will be able to find all the information they need to know about the charity, their services, their contact details and how to register as a senior or as a volunteer using the appropriate form. 
- The website also contains information about the many benefits of dog ownership for seniors with a new top pick video every month. 
- There are also relevant announcements on all pages regarding the charity’s new launched newsletter, coffee morning meet ups, and offering help to senior neighbours of other areas to connect with their local support groups. 
- Finally, the Register page also includes information about how to donate and promotes the need for volunteers and the dog adoption services.

## Site Consistency

- The consistency of the website is achieved through the regular use of the same header and footer accross all pages.
- Other recurrent features are the use of round edged images accross all pages, the regular use of solid font awesome icons and a clearly defined background color palette composed of white, orange and a soft shade of green.  
- Fonts are easy to read for the target audience and also consistent accross the site with the use of Lato, sans serif in the body and Oswald, sans serif all headers. 
- Font colors are mainly black, but the site also uses two complementary colors, white and orange, for contrast depending on the background color or to highlight links accross the site.
- The simplicity of the design, easy readability and straightforward uncomplicated titles and content are adequate for the nature of this website and its target audience.

## Features

### Footer

- The Footer section is the same accross all three pages in the website adding to the feeling of consistency.
- This section includes the Registered Charity number, physical address, phone number and email address. The senior target audience is more likely to call or send an email rather than than using social media. 
- This section also includes links to all the relevant social media pages for WALKIES - Knocklyon. The social media links will be valuable for some of the seniors who use social media, for other family members and carers and for volunteers.

### Our Services page: Tailored services

- This is the section placed just under the main services list and its goal is to make a point about the flexibility of the services offered and to encourage seniors with different needs to get in touch.
- The header of this section is a h3 as it can be considered as an add-up to the services section above which has a h2 header.

### Register page: Register more section, Donate, Voulunteer, and Adopt.

- This section is placed just under the register form and contains three sub-sections, Donate, Volunteer and Adopt.

![Screenshot of Coffe mornings announcement box](docs/images/coffe_mornings_walkies.PNG)

### Features to implement in the future

- As the WALKIES network develops in Dublin and nationally, a future improvement could be adding a section with links to the charity's partner branches in the register section. 
- As the project of the Newsletter develops, an idea would be to create a fourth page called News to feature all the newsletters published so far and including the testimonials from seniors and volunteers.
- Finally another future project would be the creation of a Resources page to include links to interesting articles and websites regarding pet care, best pets for seniors, information about local groomers, vets, or even pet-friendly care homes, to name a few.

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- I used Edge, Chrome and Firefox desktop browsers to ensure cross-compatibility.
- I used devtools to simulate different smaller screen sizes down to 320px in width as well as testing on several personal devices including Android tablets and mobile phones.
- I asked a group of friends and relatives to test the functionality of the website on their devices, to check every link, to complete the register form, and to also check for spelling mistakes, etc.

### Issues and Fixes

1. Intended Outcome: A balanced Services section with a list of services offered and some relevant photos
   - Issue: To begin with I had a photo gallery of eight photos in this section which was too big and imposing and was taking the attention away from the services list. 
   - Solution: I selected the four most relevant photos and reduced the size and height of the gallery to bring more attention to the actual Services list. The photos may be relevant and have their place in this section but the Services list is essential for the target audience so this brings a more balanced viewing / reading of this section. 

2. Intended outcome: A relevant hero image was crucial for the website as the image on the landing page is the first impression of the website which cannot be undone. The hero image has to speak for itself as an image is worth more than a thousand words and by seeing it users get a general idea of what the website is all about.
   - Issue: I was only able to find images of seniors with dogs which format was not suitable for the elongated hero image format that I wanted to achieve so I settled for a photo of a sausage dog wearing a harness and on the lead. Although the image was stunning and relevant in the way that the dog was being walked and this website is offering dog walking services, it still didn't transmit the purpose of WALKIES - Knocklyon and how it aims to helps seniors.
   - Solution: I kept looking until I found a suitable image which transmits what the website is about. I replaced the hero image a few weeks into the project.

3. Intended outcome: Clear visibility of links accross the website.
  - Issue: Some of the feedback I got from friends is that the direct links to the register form from other sections (eg. from the Newsletter section) were not clearly visible as neither was the link to the GoFundMe page from the Donate section. The links were emphasized (em) and also were underlined on hover but were not visible at first view and could be missed.
  - Fix: Using the same color palette of the website I used a different font color (white and orange) depending on the background color (white over orange and green and orange over white).

4. Intended outcome: Center the About us section image in its div
  - Issue: The div containing the image floats right and the image itself was not centered in the div. The align-items and text-align attributes were not achieving the desired outcome.
  - Fix: I found the answer in the "Love Running" project provided by the Code Institue and achieved the desired result by setting the margin: 0 auto.

5. Intended outcome: Website elements optimised scaling depeding on browser's settings.
  - Issue: Some of the feedback I received from my mentor was to avoid the use of pixels as a unit as much as possible as rem allows for optimised scalability depending on a user's browser settings.
  - Solution: I converted most of the pixels into rem measures with some exceptions like image sizes.

6. Intended outcome: A Services-more section which includes the divs Donate, Volunteer and Adopt and that is clear of other sections.
  - Issue: Before I included the announcement box at the bottom of this section, services-more was directly over the footer and the social media icons kept overlapping with it. After checking on DevTools I realised that only a small part at the top of the register-more section was highlighted when I hovered over it. 
  - Fix:I researched how to include all of the divs inside the section. The three divs were inside the section tags and the height of the section was set to auto, but I found out that because all of the divs had floating elements I had to include a last div within the section as a clearing element before I ended the section and style it in CSS (clear: both). I found the answer in the Stackoverflow website as credited below. After doing this the height of the section was highlighted as it was intended in the DevTools and the footer was no longer overlapping. I used this technique again in the About us and Tailored services sections by creating a class id="clear".

7. Intended outcome: Hide one of the sihouette icons part of the Our Services header in screens 500px and under.
  - Issue: When using DevTools to test for small screens I realised that the black silhouette icon to the right of the Our Services header was pushed under the header. 
  - Fix: I researched how to hide an image in responsive design using CSS (display: none). I found the answer in the sitewizard website as credited below.

8. Intended outcome: Achieve  high Performance score in Lighthouse for all screen sizes.
   - Issue: When first testing in Lighthouse my performance score was over 90 for desktop but went down considerably when testing for mobile sizes.
   - Fix: Resize images using the simpleimageresizer.com website and then compress them further with TinyPNG.com

9. - Intended outcome: Achieve higher Accessibility score in Lighthouse for the Register page.
      - Issue: As realised testing with Lighthouse, the "volunteer" id was not unique as I had used it twice in register.html.
      - Fix: I gave the label in the register form a new "volunteer-reg" id.

### Unfixed issues

1. - Intended outcome: Achieve higher Accessibility score in Lightouse for the Services page.
      - Issue: According to the Lightouse tool the accessibility score for this page is 93 because there is a direct link to the register page from the tailored-services section and its hypertext has a white font color over a green background.
      - Fix: I decided to leave the font color untouched as it is part of the general color scheme and palette of the website and this specific hypertext is composed by only two words (Register here.) so it will not affect the general accessibility of the page and it plays its purpose being displayed in a different font color than the rest of the text in this section as it is highlighted. I also asked friends and family and the feedback was that this hypertex displays well enough even in mobile screens. A 93 score is an ok score to keep taken all of this into account.

2. Intended outcome: Have a high Best Practices score in all three pages.
   - Issue: When using Lighthouse I realised that the index.html page had a score of 92 in Best Practices while my other two pages had a score of 100. The issue type in Lighthouse was a "SameSite cookie" issue. I narrowed down the issue to a YouTube iframe as the Best Practices score went up to 100 if the video section was commented out.
   - Fix: I seeked advice in the Project Portfolio1 Slack channel and one of the mentors mentioned that this was a server side issue so out of my control. The 92 score is acceptable so I have decided it to keep the iframe as it brings an interesting feature to the website. Also if I test the index.html page with Lighthouse via an incognito browser window then I get 100 in Best Practices as there is no interference with browser extensions so this issue may be a "non issue" after all.

### Post Development Testing

- HTML Validator: https://validator.w3.org/nu/
  - Issue found: Stray end of div in register.html
    - The solution was simply to locate and remove the stray end of div

  - Issue found: The services gallery section needed a header (yellow warning)
    - The solution I used was turning the services gallery and the services list into two divs instead of sections and I then placing them inside the same secion called Services which has a h2 header.


- CSS Validator: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
    - The CSS code was validated as CSS Level3 +SVG with no errors found.

### Tecnhical reference

The project was influenced by the Code Institute's code along project called Love running where I took inspiration for the placement of the logo, navigation bar and hero image with a zoom effect.

For the rest of the code I mainly relied on the HTML and CSS learning content available on Code Institute's LMS. I also relied heavily upon upon W3schools and used stack overflow and thesitewizard to fix two of the bugs as already mentioned in the Issues and fixes section.
